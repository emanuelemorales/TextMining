# Text Mining Project

Text Analysis is becoming a fundamental tool in Data Science, because of the importance of parsing texts in order to extract machine-readable facts from them.

The goal of this text mining project is to accomplish to three main tasks:

* **First Task - Data Cleaning and Pre-processing on Facebook comments:**
1. removing punctuation and stop words;
2. Tokenization of the text;

4. Split corpus in sentences;
5. Bag of words;
6. TF-IDF and document term matrix;
7. Implementation with pipelines of the previous tasks.

* **Second Task - Classification, Clustering and Topic Model of SMS (Spam Detection):**

1. Classification with Logistic Regression;
2. K-means Clustering;
3. Topic Model using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation);

* **Third Task - Summarization of a text:** 

1. Application of TextRank algorithm to summarize a text from a WW2 TextBook.
